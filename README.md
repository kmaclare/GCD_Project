# GCD_Project
Course Project for Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course offered by JHU/Coursera

The purpose of this repository is to share the R code to process data from Human Activity Trackers available at UCI Human Activity Research.

If you download the zip file from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

And extract the zip file to your hard drive - it will create a sub-directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".  

Place my R file in the working directory (one level up from UCI HAR Dataset)

When you run the R code, it will generate a subset of data with the average of the means and standard deviations across all axes of motion, for 30 subjects who are recorded performing 6 activities.

Both Time-based and Frequency-based data is collected from the accelerometers contained within the Smartphones worn on the hips of the subjects.
